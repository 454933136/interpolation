Some new paper upon this research:

part1:papers 
1)A Temporally-Aware Interpolation Network for Video Frame Inpainting.pdf 
2)Context-aware Synthesis for Video Frame Interpolation.pdf 
3)Fast Semantic Segmentation on Video Using Motion Vector-Based Feature Interpolation.pdf 
4)FrameInterpolationwithMulti-ScaleDeepLossFunctionsandGenerative AdversarialNetworks.pdf

This code is based on (paper 2)but some small modification.
